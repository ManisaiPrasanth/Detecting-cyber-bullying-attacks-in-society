Social networking and online chatting application provide a platform for user to share knowledge and talent, but few users take this platform to threaten users with cyberbullying attacks which cause issues in using these platforms.
Cyberbullying is the process of sending wrong messages to a person or any community which causes large debate with users.
Cyberbullying is considered as misuse of technology.According to the latest survey done on all over the world data,day by day,cases are increasing on cyberbullying.
In order to solve this problem many natural language processing techniques are proposed by various authors which are time taking and not atomic.
With advancement of machine learning and artificial intelligence, models can be created and automatic detection can be implemented.
Soft ware tools used:
In this embedded machine learning technique the main tool used as NLTK .
This embedded machine learning is also known as “Tiny ML”.
Machine Learning in embedded systems allows the use of that data in automated business processes to make more educated predictions.
Usage of tool:
In this project NLTK is used for data classification of the words,rich set of text processing and NLP tools. 
It allows you to preprocess and analyze text data efficiently, making it easier to extract 
sentiment insights from text.
Embedded machine learning helps to predict the cyberbullying words.
And to find the accuracy and confusion matrix.
Algorithms used:
For cyberbully classification, nlp(natural language processing) algorithm is used. 
 Natural language processing helps computers communicate with humans in their own language and scales other language-related tasks.
NLP makes it possible for computers to read text, hear speech, interpret it, measure sentiment and determine which parts are important.
Work done in step-by-step process:
The various modules for the proposed system are GUI designing, Training dataset, classification and analyzing the twitter messages for the presence of spam content. The classification technique is implemented using Naïve Bayes Classifier Algorithm. The Revelation consists of the following steps. The primary step is to accept data sets from numerous online network sites. 
There are some steps regarding methodology they are:
Tokenization.
Stop words Removal.
Replacement of Special Characters.
Stemming and Lemmatization .
Coreference Resolution .
